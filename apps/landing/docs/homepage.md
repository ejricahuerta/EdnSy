# PROBLEM SECTION

## Heading
Technology Was Supposed to Save Time

## Body
Most businesses have invested in software, tools, and platforms, but those systems don’t work together.

Instead of saving time:
- Workflows stay manual
- Teams avoid using systems
- Owners become the glue holding everything together

Technology didn’t fail.  
Implementation and adoption did.
