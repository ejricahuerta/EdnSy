      heading: "What Is Voice AI?",
      body: "Voice AI for business is an AI-powered phone system that answers calls 24/7, qualifies leads, books appointments, and handles common inquiries using natural conversation. For Toronto service businesses (from clinics and salons to contractors and realtors), it acts as a 24/7 AI receptionist so you never miss a lead.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Why Businesses Miss Calls",
      body: "When you're in a meeting, with a client, or after hours, every unanswered call is a potential customer going to a competitor. Toronto businesses lose thousands in revenue each year to missed calls, voicemail abandonment, and long hold times. Voice AI solves this by answering every call instantly, capturing contact details, and booking appointments into your calendar, even at midnight or on weekends.",
    },
    {
      heading: "How Our AI Voice System Works",
      body: "We train an AI voice assistant on your business: your services, availability, and booking flow. It integrates with your calendar (e.g. Google Calendar or Cal.com) and optionally your CRM. When someone calls, the AI answers, asks qualifying questions, and can book appointments or take messages. You get a summary and the lead in your system. No more playing phone tag.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Industries That Benefit",
      body: "Healthcare and dental practices, salons and spas, contractors, real estate agents, legal firms, fitness studios, and solo professionals across Toronto and the GTA all benefit from 24/7 AI call answering. Any business that relies on inbound calls for appointments or leads is a fit.",
    },
    {
      heading: "ROI & Lead Capture Benefits",
      body: "Clients typically see more booked appointments, zero missed-call leads, and 15–20+ hours saved per month on phone tag and admin. The system pays for itself when it captures even a few extra leads or appointments each month that would have been lost.",

    {
      question: "What is Voice AI for business?",
      answer:
        "Voice AI for business is an AI phone system that answers your business calls 24/7, qualifies callers, books appointments, and captures leads using natural conversation, like a receptionist that never sleeps. In Toronto, we deploy it so service businesses never miss a call.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an AI phone answering system cost?",
      answer:
        "Costs vary by complexity and volume. We offer setup and monthly plans tailored to Toronto businesses. Many clients see ROI within the first month from captured leads and saved time. Book a free strategy call for a custom quote.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Voice AI integrate with my calendar and CRM?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We integrate with Google Calendar, Cal.com, and common CRMs so the AI can check availability and book appointments directly. We design the flow around your existing tools.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it really 24/7?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The AI answers calls around the clock: weekends, holidays, and after hours. That’s when many Toronto prospects call; with Voice AI, you capture those leads instead of losing them to voicemail.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with Voice AI in Toronto?",

        "Book a free strategy call with Ed & Sy. We’ll review your call volume and booking process, then outline a custom Voice AI setup. No commitment required.",

      heading: "What Is Business Automation?",
      body: "Business automation means using software and workflows to handle repetitive tasks (invoicing, follow-ups, data entry, scheduling) so you and your team focus on clients and growth. We add AI when it helps: smart routing, summaries, or triggers that save even more time. For Toronto service businesses, it often means connecting your CRM, email, and calendar so leads are nurtured and appointments are confirmed without manual work.",

      heading: "Manual Tasks Costing You Time",

That’s time that could go into sales, service delivery, or life outside work. Business automation services in Toronto help you reclaim that time by automating those workflows.",

      heading: "Workflow Automation Examples",
      body: "Common automations we build: payment reminders and invoice follow-ups, new-lead nurturing sequences, appointment reminders and confirmations, client onboarding checklists, and status updates that pull from your tools. Where it adds value, we layer in AI (e.g. summarizing threads, routing by intent, or classifying leads). We use platforms like Google Workspace, Notion, and CRMs with strong APIs so you don’t need a patchwork of expensive apps.",
    },
    {
      heading: "CRM + Email + Calendar Integration",
      body: "Your CRM, email, and calendar should work together. We design automations that sync contacts, log activities, trigger emails, and update calendars so nothing falls through the cracks. When useful, we add AI (e.g. draft replies, priority scoring, or next-best-action suggestions). For Toronto businesses already using Google Calendar, Gmail, or tools like Cal.com, we integrate with what you have.",
    },
    {
      heading: "Industry Applications",
      body: "Healthcare and dental practices use automation for recalls and reminders. Contractors and realtors use it for lead follow-up and scheduling. Salons and fitness studios automate bookings and reminders. We tailor each workflow to your industry and your current tools.",

      answer:
        "Business automation services help you replace manual, repetitive work with automated workflows (e.g. follow-up emails, invoice reminders, appointment confirmations, and CRM updates). In Toronto, we design and implement these workflows so you save time and never drop a lead.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to implement workflow automation?",
      answer:
        "It depends on scope. Simple automations can be live in days; larger CRM and multi-tool setups may take a few weeks. We’ll give you a timeline during the free strategy call.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to replace my current tools?",
      answer:
        "Usually no. We prefer to automate what you already use (Google Calendar, Gmail, Notion, your CRM) so you don’t add cost or complexity. If a different tool is a better fit, we’ll say so.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is business process automation only for large companies?",
      answer:
        "No. We work with Toronto small businesses and solo professionals. Automation scales to your size; the goal is to save you 15–20+ hours per week and improve follow-up, not to overbuild.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does business automation include AI?",
      answer:
        "Yes, when it adds value. We use AI where it helps: summarizing conversations, routing leads, classifying requests, or suggesting next steps. Not every workflow needs AI; we only add it when it saves you more time or improves results.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started with automation in Toronto?",
