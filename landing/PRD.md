## The Problem for Home Services Businesses

We know the struggles you face daily:

* **Scheduling Chaos:** Juggling calls, emails, and technician availability leads to lost jobs and frustration.
* **Lead Management Drift:** Inquiries get lost, meaning missed opportunities for growth.
* **Information Overload:** Customer data, job histories, and equipment specs are scattered everywhere.
* **Inefficient Communication:** Constant back-and-forth between the office, field techs, and customers slows everything down.
* **Tech Overwhelm:** Most "enterprise" automation is too complex and expensive for your local business.

## Who We Help: Our Home Services Heroes

Our AI development system is laser-focused on solving problems for these key players:

* **Maria: The Home Services Business Owner**
    * **Pain:** Maria's plumbing and HVAC business is growing, but she's buried in administrative tasksâ€”scheduling, invoicing, routing, and customer follow-ups. She's missing out on new jobs because she can't keep up.
    * **Goal:** She needs to automate daily operations, cut down admin time, boost customer satisfaction with faster responses, and gain more time to grow her business.
* **David: The Office Manager/Dispatcher**
    * **Pain:** David is constantly swamped with calls, emails, and texts for scheduling changes and dispatching technicians for Reliable Repairs. Data entry is repetitive and prone to errors across multiple spreadsheets and outdated software.
    * **Goal:** He wants to automate routine scheduling, consolidate customer info, optimize technician routing, and reduce errors to make the office run smoother.
* **Jennifer: The Field Technician**
    * **Pain:** Jennifer, a landscaper, often has to call the office for job details or customer history. Paperwork after each job is tedious, and communication with the office can be a bottleneck.
    * **Goal:** She wants instant job assignments and customer details on her phone, less paperwork, quick answers from the office, and easy ways to update job statuses.

## Dive into Our Demos (All Powered by n8n!)

Our demo section (`/demos`) is where the magic happens. You'll get 200 free credits (enough for 8-10 full scenarios!) just for signing up with your Google account. When you onboard, we'll highlight the **Home Services** industry, ensuring you see the most relevant examples.

Here's a sneak peek at the four core demo types, all built with **n8n** behind the scenes:

### 1. AI Assistant (Chat or Voice)

* **What it does:** Imagine an AI handling your scheduling or answering customer questions instantly.
* **Home Services Example:** A customer messages, "Can I book a furnace check-up for next Tuesday at 10 AM?" The AI, via **n8n**, checks your simulated calendar, confirms availability, and books it directly into your technician's schedule. You can even see how the AI learns from your website!

### 2. Tasks Automation (Lead to Sale Flow)

* **What it does:** Automate your entire lead-to-sale journey, from initial inquiry to final booking.
* **Home Services Example:** A prospect requests a plumbing quote via your website form. **n8n** instantly sends an automated welcome email, an SMS confirms their inquiry, and a new lead is created in your simulated CRM, assigned to the right person.

### 3. Data Insights with Prompts

* **What it does:** Get quick answers and KPIs from your business data without complex analysis.
* **Home Services Example:** Upload a simulated CSV of your technician work logs. Prompt the AI (powered by **n8n**) with questions like, "What was our average service time for HVAC repairs last month?" or "Show us technicians with the highest job completion rates."

### 4. Business Operations with Messaging Platform Integration

* **What it does:** Manage your entire business operations from your favorite messaging app.
* **Home Services Example:** A customer messages (simulated WhatsApp) about a burst pipe. The AI, powered by **n8n**, processes the urgent request, checks your simulated Field Service Management (FSM) system for the nearest available technician, books an emergency appointment, notifies the technician, and sends an ETA to the customer. Your technicians can even message the AI for HR policies!

## Our Technical Backbone

Our platform is built with **SvelteKit 5 + TypeScript** on the frontend and **SvelteKit server-side functions** for the backend. **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** handles our database and Google OAuth authentication. Crucially, **n8n** is the engine powering all our demo logic and simulated workflows, leveraging its vast integration capabilities. We use HubSpot for CRM, Calendly for booking, and Vercel for fast, global hosting.
